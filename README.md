This tutorial teaches the basics of building a web API with ASP.NET Core.


  Create a web API project.
  Add a model class and a database context.
  Scaffold a controller with CRUD methods.
  Configure routing, URL paths, and return values.
  Call the web API with Postman.
  
  
At the end, you have a web API that can manage "to-do" items stored in a database.
